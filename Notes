Notes

random Chord sequence:
	generates a cool sequence of random chords in a given key 
	— hard code the chords in at first
	— then work on a way to randomly produce chords for a given key
			check JMOD quantize methods
			check availabe scales within the library

WHEN ENFORCING KEY, if going up +1 to get to key, if going down -1 to get to key to go in direction of movement

for randomNewNotes —> option for playing strictly those notes or a multiple of those notes?

for my siren notes, want an option for playing current notes from the chord

maybe want a mimic option —> 

Need to do math for WahPeddle


Linked Effects:
	
	4 acceleration spikes --> soft drumbeat
	acceleration spike -->  chord change
	lean --> while leaning, higher siren note
	while less movement --> bass notes
